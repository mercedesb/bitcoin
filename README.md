# The Bitcoin Arbitrage App

## Current Features
 - The main page has a description of cryptocurrency arbitrage as well as a general introduction to the topic.
 - The final sale is the two tiered subscription status. The first allows access to the /coins route, which provides arbitrage opportunities. The second provides more direct access with an API route. 
 - Bot notification systems are also accessible to the top tier services.

## Future Plans
Here we have some developments we are planning on implementing in the future.
### AI Bots
 - Discord
 - Telegram

## Advanced Authentication
Our authentication servers reside on both Firebase and MongoDB, the first protecting the HTML /Cards route, the second protecting the /API/Cards route. This is where the data is processed and output, and this is the part of the program that is potentially worth a subscription service.
